The word "coalition" originates from the Latin term "coalitio," which means "a growing together" or "fellowship." Here's a detailed breakdown of its etymology:

Origin: The term comes from the Latin verb "coalescere," meaning "to unite, grow together, or become one in growth." This reflects the idea of different entities coming together for a common purpose.

Historical Development:
The word entered English in the early 1600s, with its first recorded use around 1605.
It was borrowed from the Medieval Latin "coalitio," which itself derived from the earlier Latin form.

Meaning: In contemporary usage, a coalition refers to a temporary alliance of distinct parties or groups that come together to achieve a specific goal. This is commonly seen in political contexts, where different political parties may form a coalition government.

Political Context: The political sense of the term as a "voluntary temporary union of persons, parties, nations, etc., for the attainment of a certain object" has been attested since around 1715.

In summary, "coalition" reflects the concept of unity and collaboration among diverse groups or individuals working toward a shared objective.
